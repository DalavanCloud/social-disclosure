                      You will be assigned a preference profile and asked to choose one (1) product from a list of products. Each product gives you a certain amount of tokens, determined by the interaction of the product's attributes and your preference profile. </p>
  	                <p>
                      As an example, if your preference profile were the following: ((table)) This means that you value attribute A with intensity 1, attribute B with intensity 2, and attribute C with intensity 3.
  	                </p>
  	                <p>
                      If you were shown two products, product 1 and product 2, which had different attribute values as shown in the following table:
  	                </p>
                    <p>
                      Then you would receive 1*5+2*1+3*1=10 tokens for product 1, and 1*1+2*1+3*3=12 tokens for product 2. The best choice for you would be product 2, in this example, because you receive more tokens from product 2 than product 1.
